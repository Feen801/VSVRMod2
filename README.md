Here are some things to know:
* There is a Unity Project in the "Unity Project" folder. 
  * To obtain the .dll files included in "Virtual Succubus_Data" with each release of this mod, you can build that project. You only need the ones the base game doesn't already have.
  * To obtain the asset files files included in "Virtual Succubus_Data/StreamingAssets" with each release of this mod, create the asset bundles for that project.
* I did not include the "Assembly-CSharp.dll" file in this repo even though the project depends on it, because it may contain base game code. You can get it from a copy of VS and place it in "Libs/Managed."
